**DRY ** - Don't Repeat Yourself
**KISS** - Keep It Simple stupid
**YAGNI** - You Aren't Gonna Need It

**KISS - KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID**
The programming language is for humans to understand, computers can only understand 0 1, so keep coding simple and straight, which should be 
easily understandable by human beings.

Keep your methods small, each method should never be more than 40-50 lines.

**YAGNI**
You are not going to need it, or YAGNI is a principle of extreme programming.  XP. XP is generally used in the Agile software development process.

YAGNI says- do not add any functionality until it's deemed necessary; in other words,  write the code which you need in the current situation. 
Don't add anything if you think will need it. 
Add your code logic for the present, don't think of what may be needed in the future. 

Difference between Top-down and Bottom-up Approach
|Top-Down Approach|Bottom-Up Approach|
|-----------------|------------------|
|Divides a problem into smaller units and then solve it.	|Starts from solving small modules and adding them up together.|
|This approach contains redundant information.	|Redundancy can easily be eliminated.|
|A well-established communication is not required.	|Communication among steps is mandatory.|
|The individual modules are thoroughly analysed.	|Works on the concept of data-hiding and encapsulation.|
|Structured programming languages such as C uses top-down approach.	|OOP languages like C++ and Java, etc. uses bottom-up mechanism.|
|Relation among modules is not always required.	T|he modules must be related for better communication and work flow.|
|Primarily used in code implementation, test case generation, debugging and module documentation.	|Finds use primarily in testing.|
