**Explanation:** <br/>
**Defines simplified communication between classes. Mediator Design Pattern allows multiple objects to communicate with each other without knowing each other’s structure. This pattern defines an object which encapsulates how the objects will interact with each other’s and support easy maintainability of the code by loose coupling.**


**Participant** <br/>
**Mediator[]** <br/>
**ConcreteMediator[]** <br/>
**Colleague[]** <br/>
**ConcreteCollegue[]** <br/>

**MediatR Nuget package is available to implement this pattern**

IMediator
  _mediator.Send<Tresponse>(IRequest<Tresponse> req, CancellationToken , token= default);
IRequest<Tresponse>
  request object should inherit Irequest
IRequestHandler<Trequest, Tresponse>
   Request handler should inherit Irequesthandler the you can override Handle method which will get executed when newrequst is sent.
  Task<Tresponse> Handle(TRequest request, CancelationToken token)

  
Request

```
